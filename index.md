# Affine Cipher

Simple & easy-to-use Affine Cipher GUI. It allows multi-time enciphering & deciphering. It uses 3 different key pairs for 3 different alphabets: digits, uppercase & lowercase letters. Characters that are not in these 3 alphabets are not touched. Press _R_ to reset settings to defaults. You can view it [here](affine-cipher.html).
